        Hi! My name is Luke Martin and I currently live in Denver, CO. I grew up outside of Philadelphia, PA and went to Syracuse University where I studied advertising. I eventually moved to New York City and worked in advertising there for 4 years. I decided to move to Colorado in January 2019 and have been here ever since!
